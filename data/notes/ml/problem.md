## Inputs and Outputs

Throughout the course, we are going to motivate our discussion with actual case studies of folks applying machine learning to problems in medicine. The first problem we'll consider is that of detecting pneumonia in chest x-rays. Consider the following excerpt from a 2017 paper on binary on (Rajpurkar *et al.*, 2017) 

> CheXNet 2.1. **Problem Formulation** The pneumonia detection task is a binary classification problem, where the input is a frontal-view chest X-ray image and the output is a binary label indicating the absence or presence of pneumonia respectively.
